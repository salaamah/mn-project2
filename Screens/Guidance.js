        All prays is due to Allah, The One Who honored the Prophet’s Mosque with a great virtue in the hearts which obey Their Lord and follow the prophet’s sunnah, O Allah send your peace and prayers upon him, to proceed:{"\n"}
        From the signs which reflect the virtue of the Prophet’s Mosque
      </Text>
      <Text style = {styles.textHeading}>
        1. It is a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day:
      </Text>
      <Text style = {styles.text}>
        Allah said: Do not stand [for prayer] within it - ever. A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in. Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and Allah loves those who purify themselves. [A-Tawbah:108]{"\n"}
        It was narrated by Ibn Abi Sa'eed Al-Khudri that his father said: "Two men argued about the Masjid which was founded on piety from the first day. One man said that it was the Masjid of Quba', and the other said that it was the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah (peace and prayers be upon him) then the Messenger of Allah (peace and prayers be upon him) said: 'It is this Masjid of mine.'"{"\n"}
        This virtue includes his mosque -peace and prayers be upon him- and the Mosque of Quba. As mentioned by ِAl-Hafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) 
        Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah - may Allah have mercy on him - said: The previous verse was revealed because of the Quba Mosque, then he said: “But this virtue is including Masjid Quba and the prophet’s mosque because it is more entitled and this is what was proven in the Sahih by the Prophet -peace and blessings be upon him- ” He was asked about the mosque that was founded on righteousness, and he said: “It is my mosque.””

      <Text style = {styles.textHeading}>
        2. The reward of one prayer in the Prophet’s mosque is more than one-thousands anywhere else:
      </Text>
      <Text style = {styles.text}>
        Allahs’s Messenger said, “One prayer in this mosque of mine (i.e. the Prophet’s Mosque) is better than a thousand elsewhere, except the Grand Mosque.”
      </Text>
      <Text style = {styles.textHeading}>
        3. It is from the Three Mosques which the religious journey can be made to them:
      </Text>
      <Text style = {styles.text}>
        Abu Huraira reported that Allah’s Messenger said: “Animals are saddled [i.e. making the religious journey] for prayer only to the three mosques the Sacred Mosque, Aqsa Mosque, and this mosque of mine [i.e. the Prophet’s Mosque].” {"\n"}
        Also, if a worshiper came to it for teaching or learning so he will be as a Mujahid, Abu Hurairah said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah says: 'Whoever comes to this mosque of mine, and only comes for a good purpose, such as to learn or to teach, his status is like Mujahid. And whoever comes for any other purpose, his status is that like a man who is keeping an eye on other people's property.'"{"\n"}
        It is the last mosque which was built by a prophet, so its virtue upon other mosques is as the virtue of the prophet upon other prophets, the messenger of Allah -may Allah’s peace and prayers be upon him- said: “I am the last of the prophets and my Masjid is the last of the Masjids”

      <Text style = {styles.textHeading}>
        4. Inside it there is a garden from the Paradise as the prophet has told:
      </Text>
      <Text style = {styles.text}>
        Abo Hurairah Narrated that the prophet said: “which lies between my house and pulpit is one of the gardens of Paradise, and my minber is on my Hawdh”{"\n"}
        Om Salamah narrated that the messenger of Allah, may Allah’s peace and prayers be upon him said, "What is between my house and my mimbar is one of the gardens of paradise,  and The columns of this Minbar of mine will be in Paradise."{"\n"}
        Abu Huraira narrated that Allah’s messenger said, " I have been commanded to go to a town which will devour all towns. People call it Yathrib, but it is Medina. It drives away people as the bellows drives away the impurity of iron.”{"\n"}
        And when the prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) came to Almadinah they welcomed him and were holding the noseband of his she-camel saying: “come O messenger of Allah to the peace and protection” but the prophet was saying: “ let her walk without holding the noseband because she has been commanded [i.e. by Allah]”, then she sat at the place of the Prophet’s Mosque”{"\n"}
        Moreover, it is the center of knowledge and calling to worship Allah The Almighty, and it is the first school in Islam, also  it contains the virtuous milestones. In it the prophetic pulpit, the Noble Rawdah, the prayer place of the Messenger of Allah(peace and blessings be upon him)  and it has the Prophetic Chamber. All these virtues are a prove on the great reward of  expanding and maintaining its building as well as serving the visitors.

      <Text style = {styles.textHeading}>
        5. It was built by the prophet and his companions:
      </Text>
      <Text style = {styles.text}>
        The virtue of the Prophet's Mosque is a clear indication of the reward of maintaining its expansion and restoration and the virtue of its architecture is evidenced by the great interest of the Prophet as he bought the land of the mosque, repaired it for its reconstruction with his companions and urged them to do so. It was mentioned in Sahih Albukhari that Allah's Messenger (peace and prayers be upon him) established the mosque of Quba then prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Messenger (peace and prayers be upon him) at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there, and that place was a Mirbad for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Messenger (peace and prayers be upon him) said, "This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place." Allah's Messenger (peace and prayers be upon him) then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that Mirbad so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, "No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah's Messenger (peace and prayers be upon him)!" Allah's Messenger (peace and prayers be upon him) then built the mosque there. The Prophet (peace and prayers be upon him) himself started carrying bricks for building and while doing so, he was saying "This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable." He was also saying, "O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants."
        In another narration from Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the prophet sent for some people of Banu-An-Najjar and said, "O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land of yours." They replied, "No! By Allah! We do not demand its price except from Allah." Anas added: There were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees in it. The Prophet (peace and prayers be upon him) ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led and the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees towards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). His companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet (peace and prayers be upon him) was with them and he kept on saying, "There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Allah! So please forgive the Ansars and the emigrants. "{"\n"}
        In the Hadeeth that Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated is a clear prove on the reward of maintaining the Prophet’s Mosque which is “there was an fallow land next to the Prophet Mosque then the prophet said ‘`Who will buy it and he will have a land like it in the Paradise?’”{"\n"}
        Sheikh of Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Abu Ghassan said: More than one of the trustworthy people told me: that Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) increased the place of the Mihrab, then it has not been changed until today.{"\n"}
        After the era of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and prayers be upon him) the great interest of the caliphs and kings in the Prophet’s Mosque expanding is increased  following their Prophet (may Allah’s peace and prayers be upon him). This interest has been passing through the era of the Four Caliphs, then the Umayyads, then the Abbasids, then the era of the Sultans and Mamelukes, then the Ottomans, until this devolving era which is the era of the Saudi state that has paid a great attention to the Prophet’s Mosque (may Allah’s peace and prayers be upon him). until it became a lofty building, a luminous beacon, and Islamic Arabic historical architecture.
